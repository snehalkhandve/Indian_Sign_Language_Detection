# Indian_Sign_Language_Detection
  This project aims to help disabled people to communicate with common people who do not understand their Sign language.
In this project we have implemented :
1. Realtime capturing of hand gestures by your laptop camera .
2. Recognising the gestures and displaying the English word user wants to convey.
